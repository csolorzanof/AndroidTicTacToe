# Tic Tac Toe Game
Small android application that implements the Tic Tac Toe game for two players taking turns touching the screen. 
Created with Android Studio following the course: 
[The Complete Android Kotlin Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WaoBUAdcl9XRw==/)

## Modifications
The game logic has been modified from what is shown in the course, taking advantage of Kotlin's 
advances since the course was released and personal refactoring of the code itself.
